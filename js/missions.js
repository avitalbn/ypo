Then make your way to the lookout point that gazes over the stretch of sand with TONS of beached Sea Lions. You really can’t miss it. <br>Once there you guys will be able to get up close and personal with some of California’s most beloved sea creatures. Exactly how close (and exactly how personal) is up to you, but be advised that some of the males are INCREDIBLY randy this time of year. And, you’ll probably be imprisoned if you molest the wildlife. In your RV, you’ll find a duffel bag. Open it and find the tools that you’ll use to pose as these animals and perform a video called: ‘A Day in The Life of an Elephant Seal.’ Bonus points for getting real elephant seals in the background of the video. Fighting? Mating? Responding to Climate Change? Totally up to you. Just make it entertaining. Your video will be evaluated on how well you impersonate a seal and how well you execute your idea.<br><br><b>REMINDER: ONLY TAKE PHOTOS WITH DIGITAL CAMERA PROVIDED</b> <br><b>DO NOT TAKE PHOTOS WITH IPAD OR PERSONAL PHONES</b>",

Your team has 10 minutes to reenact your chosen moment, but wait, there's a catch. The 20-30 second film must be shot ENTIRELY IN REVERSE. That's right, backwards. We recommend throwing in a bit of slow motion for dramatic effect. Take a moment to brainstorm, and once you reach the Waypoint called <i>Monastery</i>, march down to the beach and make magic happen.
